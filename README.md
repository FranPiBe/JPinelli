# Fran Pinelli Bernard - Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases projects and experiments that I have developed over the years as a data scientist. The goal is to present a collection of work spanning machine learning, geospatial analysis and data engineering tasks.

## Projects
- **Bootcamp-master** – Notebooks from the Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp.
- **Choropleth map with time sliders** – Interactive visualization for network monitoring data.
- **Explore radiobases** – Mapping of telecom base stations by technology.
- **Fun** – Personal experiments such as training Stable Diffusion on personal images.
- **Model practice** – Notebooks exploring advanced regression, classification and model evaluation.
- **Radiobases highways** – Correlation analysis between base stations and highway networks.
- **Workflow grain model** – Data pipeline and model training for grain quality prediction.
- **sql processes** – JSON definitions for ETLs built with Zepe and Sqoops to Teradata.

Each folder contains notebooks, scripts or reports related to its topic. Some material originates from older work but remains here for reference.

## Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL, C++, JavaScript
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, MicroStrategy, PowerBI
- **Other tools:** Git, Docker
